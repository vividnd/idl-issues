Hemlo Nico,I'm running into some issues with the IDL generation and Anchor 0.31.1's `Program` class. I'm not sure if this is expected behavior or if I'm doing something wrong on my end.

The error I'm getting: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'encode')`
What i noticeed :The IDLs I'm getting from `arcium build` seem to have accounts with discriminators only, but I'm not seeing the full type definitions I expected:

```json
// What I'm getting from arcium build
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Survey",
      "discriminator": [146, 73, 17, 4, 6, 233, 167, 141]
      // Missing: "type": { "kind": "struct", "fields": [...] }
    }
  ]
}
```

Is this how it's supposed to be? I was thinking it should look more like this:
```json

{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "Survey", 
      "discriminator": [146, 73, 17, 4, 6, 233, 167, 141],
      "type": {
        "kind": "struct",
        "fields": [
          { "name": "survey_type", "type": { "defined": { "name": "SurveyType" } } }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## What I've Tried So Far (Probably doing it wrong because im very noob and i just started to learn how to code)

I've been trying different approaches to get this working, but I'm clearly missing something:

1. Account Enrichment** - I tried copying types from the `types` array to the `accounts` array
   - ✅ The `BorshCoder` seemed to work when I did this
   - ❌ But then `AccountClient` failed with: `Error: Account not found: clockAccount`

2. Empty Accounts Array - I tried removing the accounts array entirely to avoid `AccountClient` errors  
   - ✅ No more `AccountClient` crash
   - ❌ But then the `BorshCoder` type registry looked empty and encoding still failed

3. Explicit BorshCoder** - I tried creating the coder manually and passing it to `Program`
   - ❌ The `Program` constructor still tried to build `AccountClient` and failed the same way

I'm clearly not understanding something fundamental here. What am I missing?**

## My Questions 

1. Is this how it's supposed to work?** Are Arcium 0.3.0 IDLs meant to be used directly with Anchor's `Program` class, or am I completely misunderstanding how to use them?

2. What should I be doing instead?** For my app, I need to make instruction calls with enum arguments but I don't really need the `program.account.*` methods - how should I be setting up the Program?

3. Am I missing some obvious utility?** Does Arcium have a helper like `createArciumProgram(IDL, provider)` that I should be using instead of the regular Anchor `Program`?

}

### 2. Frontend Code (Failing)
```typescript
import { Program, AnchorProvider } from '@coral-xyz/anchor';
import { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import IDL from './target/idl/se_qure.json';

const provider = new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet, {});
const program = new Program(IDL, provider);

// This fails with: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'encode')
const tx = await program.methods
  .submitSurveyAnalytics(
    new BN(123),
    new Uint8Array(32),
    new BN(456),
    new Uint8Array(32),
    // ... more args
  )
  .rpc();
```

### 4. Build Command Output
